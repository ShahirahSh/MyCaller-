# MyCaller-
The CallBlocker will retrieve the data from the website instead of using user data.

As you can see, the Wesbite scam zip file is the dummies website that has been created where the data of the reported scam number would be stored, and others are the call blocker mobile app that would refer to the data from the website later. Also, it uses the data from all the users that submit the report through the application.
